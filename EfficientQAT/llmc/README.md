  We modularly and fairly benchmark the quantization techniques considering calibration cost, inference efficiency, and quantized accuracy. Near 600 experiments on diverse models and datasets provide three insightful takeaways
  on the calibration data, algorithm pipeline, and quantization configuration selection. Based on the takeaways, a best practice for the LLM PTQ pipeline is designed, to achieve the best accuracy and efficiency performance balance
  under various scenarios.

- **Mar 7, 2024:** 🚀 We release the quantization part of a powerful and efficient LLM compression tool. Notably, our benchmark paper is coming soon😊.
